# MAGIC %md ### README - MLflow Export/Import
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Overview
# MAGIC * Export and import MLflow objects - runs, experiments or registered models.
# MAGIC * Copy MLflow objects from one workspace (tracking server) to another.
# MAGIC * Customers often need to copy objects (e.g. experiments) to another workspace.
# MAGIC   * For example, we train model runs in the dev workspace, and then we wish to promote the best run to a prod workspace.
# MAGIC   * Can't do this today.
# MAGIC   * Customer experiment data is currently locked into a workspace and not portable.
# MAGIC * These notebooks are an unofficial tool that address this problem.
# MAGIC * For details see:
# MAGIC   * [MLflow Export Import](https://databricks.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UN/pages/800754006/MLflow+Export+Import) - wiki page

# MAGIC #### Notebooks
# MAGIC * Run
# MAGIC   * [Export_Run]($./Export_Run) - export run to folder
# MAGIC   * [Import_Run]($./Import_Run) - import run from folder
# MAGIC * Experiment
# MAGIC   * [Export_Experiment]($./Export_Experiment) - export experiment (and all its runs) to folder
# MAGIC   * [Import_Experiment]($./Import_Experiment) - import experiment from folder
# MAGIC * Registered Model
# MAGIC   * [Export_Model]($./Export_Model) - export model (and runs of all its versions) to folder
# MAGIC   * [Import_Model]($./Import_Model) - import model from folder
# MAGIC * [Common]($./Common)
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC #### Limitations
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * The OSS export/import logic is solid.
# MAGIC * Databricks limitations:
# MAGIC   * We cannot export the notebook revision linked to a run since the Databricks workspace API does not support exporting/importing notebook revisions.
# MAGIC   * As a convenience, when a run is exported the notebook (current revision) is exported. It is not attached to any run.
# MAGIC   * When importing a run you will have a dead notebook revision ID link.

# MAGIC #### Setup
# MAGIC * Attach to your cluster (demo shard): `dbfs:/home/andre.mesarovic@databricks.com/lib/wheels/mlflow_export_import-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`
